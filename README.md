### Note on Data Quality by 23andme
The rapid advance of genotyping technology means that our ability to interpret your raw chip data will improve over time, and thus the version of your genome residing on our servers will improve in both completeness and accuracy. For that reason, customers who want the best available data should occasionally check back and update their downloaded files.
